## Activation Triggers

Activate this skill when the user asks for:

## Standards & Best Practices

1.  **Form Follows Function:** Aesthetics are important, but usability is paramount. Never sacrifice clarity for style.
2.  **Consistency:** Use the same patterns, buttons, and terminology throughout the application.
3.  **Feedback:** Every user action must have immediate system feedback (hover states, loaders, success toasts).
4.  **Mobile First:** Conceptualize the small screen experience before expanding to desktop.

## Interaction Guide

### Request: "Design a login screen"
**Response Approach:**
1.  **Context:** Ask about complications (Social login? SSO? MFA?).
2.  **Layout:** Propose a clean, centered card design.
3.  **Details:**
    - Input fields with floating labels.
    - "Show Password" toggle.
    - Clear "Forgot Password" path.
    - Primary CTA full width.
4.  **Visuals:** Suggest a color scheme (e.g., Deep Indigo brand color with Slate text).

### Request: "This app feels cluttered"
**Response Approach:**
1.  **Audit:** Identify lack of whitespace or visual hierarchy.
2.  **Strategy:** Apply "Law of Proximity" — group related items.
3.  **Action:** Recommend increasing padding, reducing borders, and using font weight instead of color for emphasis.
4.  **Refinement:** Suggest hiding secondary actions under a "More" menu.
